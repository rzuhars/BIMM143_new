Today we will take a wee step back to some data we can taste, and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy. 

# Data Import

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names = 1)

View(candy)
```

### Question 1
> How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```
There are 85 types of candy in this dataset. 

### Question 2
> How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity == 1)
```
There are 38 types of fruity candy in the dataset. 

# My favorite candy

### Question 3
> What is your favorite candy in the dataset, and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Nestle Butterfinger",]$winpercent
```
My favorite candy is Butterfinger, and the win percent is about 71%. 

### Question 4
> What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```
The winpercent value for Kit Kat is about 77%. 

### Question 5
> What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent

```
The winpercent value for Tootsie Roll Snack Bars is about 50%. 

## Exploratory Analysis

Skimr can be useful when you want a quick overview of a dataset, for example, if you are encountering it for the first time. 

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

### Question 6
> Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale than the others. 

### Question 7
> What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

I think the zero represents that the candy is not chocolate, because it means the logical is false. So, the one would represent that the candy is indeed chocolate. 

**A good place to start any exploratory analysis is with a histogram. You can do this most easily with the base R function hist(). Alternatively, you can use ggplot() with geom_hist().**

### Question 8
> Plot a histogram of winpercent values

in base R:
```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

in ggplot:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fill="violet")
```

### Question 9
> Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution of winpercent values in not symmetrical. 

### Question 10
>Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)

```
The center of distribution is a bit below the mean, as it is represented by the median. 

### Question 11
> On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

for chocolate candy:
```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

for fruity candy:
```{r}
fruit.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruit.candy <- candy[fruit.inds,]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```
The average winpercent for chocolate candy is about 61%, while it is about 44% for fruity candy. The average winpercent for chocolate candy is higher than that of fruity candy. 

### Question 12
> Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```
Yes, they are statistically significant, with a P-value of 2.871e-08

# Overall Candy Rankings

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`. Here's how they work:

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x)
```
sorts the variables directly. 
```{r}
order(x)
```
gives the variable position that you need to reference in order of least to greatest. 

### Question 13
> What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head( candy[inds,], 5) # whole candy table sorted by indeces
```
The five least liked candy types are Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters. 

### Question 14
> What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[inds,], 5)
```
The five most liked candies are Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, Snickers. 

### Question 15
> Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values, with ggplot. 

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```
It's not the easiest plot to read. 

### Question 16
> This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x=winpercent,
      y=reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent),
      fill=chocolate) +
  geom_col()
```

**Time to add some useful color!**

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want- with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together whether it is a `bar` or not

```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

# mycols
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=6)
```

### Question 17
> What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets are the worst ranked chocolate candy. 

### Question 18
> What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst is the best ranked fruity candy. 

# Taking a look at pricepercent

Getting the best value for your money:

```{r}
# Pink is too light, let's change to red
mycols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 8)
```

### Question 19
> Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Peanut Butter miniatures are the highest ranked in terms of winpercent, and have a lower price. 

### Question 20
> What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[inds,], 5)
```
The most expensive candy types are Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring Pop, Hershey's Krackel, and Hershey's Milk Chocolate. Of these, Nik L Nip is the least liked. 

### Question 21
> optional, skipped

# Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
cij

corrplot(cij)
```

### Question 22
> Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

The two most negatively correlated variables are chocolate and fruity. 

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```


### Question 23
> Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

The two most positively correlated variables are either chocolate and winpercent and chocolate and bar. Let's test:

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "winpercent"], 2)

round(cij["chocolate", "bar"], 2)

```
The two most positively correlated variables are chocolate and winpercent. 

# Principal Component Analysis

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset. 

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
# pca$x
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 6, col=mycols) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy")
```
The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation`. We can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot. 

```{r}
#pca$rotation
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1) +
  geom_col()
```

### Question 24
> What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

The variables that are picked up strongly in the positive direction are fruity, pluribus, and hard. Yes, this makes sense to me because the variables with more positive values have been shown to exist together in the same candy more frequently. On the other hand, the variables with negative values correlate to each other.
