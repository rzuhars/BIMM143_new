Load up the packages we will need for analysis of protein structure sets. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

We will analyze the ADK starting with a single ADK database accession code: "1ake_A"

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

Now we can search the PDB database to find all related entries. 

```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
attributes(blast)
```

```{r}
head(blast$hit.tbl)
```

Make a little summary figure of these results:

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

Our "top hits" i.e. the most similar entries in the database are:

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files- file called "pdbs" can be found in folder
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

Align and superimpose all these structures
```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Side note: 
```{r}
library(bio3dview)

view.pdbs(pdbs)
```

This is better, but it is still difficult to see what is similar and different in all these structures or to learn much about how this family works. 

Let's try PCA: 

```{r}
pc <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)
```


```{r}
plot(pc, pc.axes = 1:2)
```

```{r}
view.pca(pc)
```

Write a PDB "trajectory" for mol-star

```{r}
mktrj(pc, file = "pca_results.pdb")
```
